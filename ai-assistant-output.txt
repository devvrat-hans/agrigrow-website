Namaste Devvrat ji!


It's February, which is the heart of the Rabi (winter) season. Let's look at your crops:


For your **Wheat** crop:
If you have sown wheat, this is a crucial time for its growth.

* Irrigation (सिंचाई): Your wheat will need its second or third irrigation now, depending on when you sowed it and the soil type. Water lightly but thoroughly, especially if there's no rain.
* Action: Check soil moisture. If it feels dry 4-6 inches deep, it's time to irrigate.
* Fertilizer (खाद): If you haven't applied the second dose of Urea, now is a good time.
* Action: Apply 30-40 kg Urea per acre, preferably before irrigation. This helps the plant grow strong tillers.
* Weed Management (खरपतवार नियंत्रण): Weeds compete with wheat for nutrients.
* Action: If you see a lot of weeds, consider using a suitable herbicide. Consult your local KVK or a nearby fertilizer shop for the right product for your specific weeds (e.g., Isoproturon for narrow-leaf weeds, 2,4-D for broad-leaf weeds). Always read the label and follow safety instructions.
* Pest & Disease Watch:
* Aphids (माहू/तेला): Keep an eye out for small green insects on the leaves or stems. If you see them, especially on younger plants, they can harm your crop.
* Organic: Spray a neem oil solution (5 ml/liter of water) every 7-10 days.
* Chemical: If infestation is high, use Imidacloprid (0.5 ml/liter of water) or Thiamethoxam (0.25 gm/liter of water).
* Frost (पाला): With cool temperatures, frost can be a risk, especially in open areas.
* Action: Light irrigation in the evening can help protect plants from frost damage. You can also create a smoke cover by burning farm waste on the field boundaries during very cold nights.

For **Rice** and **Cotton**:
These are typically Kharif (monsoon) crops. In February, your fields would likely be empty or prepared for the next season.

* Action: Start thinking about soil testing for your fields if you plan to grow these crops again in the summer/monsoon. This helps you plan your nutrient management better for the next cycle.

For your **Fruit** crops:
Fruits are a broad category. Could you tell me which specific fruits you are interested in (e.g., mango, guava, citrus, grapes)?

Generally, for fruit trees in February:

* Pruning (कटाई-छटाई): Many fruit trees benefit from light pruning to remove dead or diseased branches and shape the tree
